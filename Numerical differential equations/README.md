## Description

In this task we implemented numerical methods for differential equations. In particular, we focused on the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods which allow to specify the required step precision. These methods are applied to solve a physical problem: the motion of the simple and compound pendulum, which require solving the relative equations of motions. The solutions are visualised using the ROOT library developed by CERN (C++).
