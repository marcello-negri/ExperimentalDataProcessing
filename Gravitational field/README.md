## Description
The goal of this task is to compute the variation on the gravitational field exerted by the Earth on an orbiting sattelite when a mountain range is added on the Earth's surface. The idea is to exploit class inheritance and object instances to build and use objects representing the Earth, the Mountain range and the Gravitational Field.
