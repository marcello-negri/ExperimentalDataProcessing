## Description

In this task we first implemented a pseudo random number generator and then we exploited it to obtain specific random distributions. In order to obtain the exponential distribution it was sufficient to invert the analytical formula. For the Gaussian distribution we followed both the Boxâ€“Muller transform and the accept-reject method. These generators are added to the "My vector" class, implemented in previous exercises, and distributions are visualised using the ROOT library of CERN (C++).
