## Description
The goal of this task was to compute the gravitational potential generated by celestial objects. In order to do so, the class "corpo celeste" is created, which allows to generate the objects the Moon, the Sun, and the Earth. Once these object instances are created one can exploit the class methods to compute the gravitational field generated by one object on another one.
