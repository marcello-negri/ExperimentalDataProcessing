# ExperimentalDataProcessing

My projects for the course "Experimental Data Processing" (BSc. level - 2015) that I developed in a group of two together with Irene Veronesi. In this course we learnt the basis of **numerical methods** (pseudo random numbers, numerical integration and differential equations), developed our own vector container, used C++ object oriented programming to solve **physical problems** (gravitational field and potential) and simulated a **complete physical experiment** (Physics experiment simulation).
