# ExperimentalDataProcessing

My projects for the course "Experimental Data Processing" (BSc. level - 2018) that I developed in a group of two together with Irene Veronesi. 

In this course we learnt the basis of **numerical methods** ('Random distributions', 'Bisection Method', 'Numerical integration' and 'Differential equations'), developed our own vector container ('My vector class'), used **C++ object oriented** programming to solve physical problems ('Gravitational field' and 'Gravitational potential') and simulated a **complete physical experiment** ('Physics experiment simulation').
