## Description
In this final tasks we put together the methods and techniques developed during the course in order to simulate a real life Physics experiment. In particular, we focused on the motion of an object in a viscous fluid. The physical quantities are initiliased by sampling from a random gaussian distribution where mean values and standard deviations are adjusted to specific experimental values. These quantities are then propagated in the physical formulae to compute the measures we expect to obtain in the real experiment. Input variables distributions and measured quantities ones are visualised using the ROOT library developed by CERN (C++).
