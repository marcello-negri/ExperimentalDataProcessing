## Description

In this task we implemented numerical methods for integration of real functions. In particular, we developed the **midpoint**, **trapezoidal** and **Simpson's rules** to arbitrary precision, which is specified by the user. To illustrate the methods we used the integral of sin(x) between 0 and pi.
